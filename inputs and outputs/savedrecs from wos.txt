Several factors such as stress, depression, infection, and vaccination influenced the menstrual cycle in women during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We investigated whether there were changes in the menstrual cycle in women after COVID-19 vaccination or infection and, if so, the nature of the change. Methods. This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional study. A face-to-face survey was conducted among menstruating women aged 18-50 years from May 31 to July 31, 2022. Women were inquired about their first three menstrual cycles that occurred after COVID-19 infection or vaccination. Results. Of 241 women with COVID-19 infection, 86 (35.7%) mentioned that they experienced various changes in their menstrual patterns in the first three cycles after infection. Of 537 participants who received various COVID-19 vaccines, 82 (15.1%) stated that they experienced changes in their menstrual patterns after vaccination. The incidence of postvaccination menstrual change was higher in women who received Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac (CoronaVac) vaccines. Only 10.9% of women who reported a change in their menstrual pattern after vaccination or infection consulted a physician. Conclusion. COVID-19 infection and vaccination can affect the menstrual cycle in women. It is important to be aware of the menstrual changes after COVID-19 infection and vaccination and to warn and inform women about this issue.

Classifying a target can help radar operators figure out the nature of the target, such as its source and activity. However, it is very difficult to find the labeled data necessary to develop radar target classification models. Generating a radar dataset is an expensive and time-consuming process. To address these issues, we propose a noise reduction method that can be applied to micro-Doppler radar datasets. This method is carried out by averaging the spectrogram of each class in the RadEch micro-Doppler radar datasets and subtracting pixel by pixel from each sample. RadEch dataset has also been augmented with traditional and learning-based data augmentation methods. The learning-based data augmentation method was carried out by using Generative Adversarial Networks. Raw spectrograms, augmented spectrograms and noise-reduced spectrograms have been classified using 5-layer Convolutional Neural Network, VGG-16, and VGG-19. Classification results are compared with state-of-the-art studies. Comparison results show that the classification on noise-reduced spectrogram performs better than current state-of-the-art methods.

J	Ozcan, H				Ozcan, Halil			The Blockade of the Dardanelles Strait and the Occupation of Bozcaada During the Tripoli and Balkan Wars, Through the Eyes of Telegrapher Ihsan (Pere) Bey	CTAD-CUMHURIYET TARIHI ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI			Turkish	Article						Bozcaada; the Dardanelles; Tripoli; Balkan War; Telegrapher ihsan Pere		Tripoli and Balkan Wars accelerated the process leading to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. In these wars, the Dardanelles Strait and the islands near the strait were the common target chosen by Italy and Greece for the surrender of the Ottoman Empire. In both wars, Ihsan (Pere) Bey served as the telegraph officer of the British Eastern Cable Company in Bozcaada. The Tripoli War was continuing when Ihsan Bey, who had started his civil service as an officer of the Istanbul Beyoglu British Cable Company, was appointed as officer to Bozcaada for the second time. Ihsan Bey's witnessing in Bozcaada to the hot war of the Italian Navy and the Turkish Redoubts on April 18, 1912 and the detailed information he has given are important. In addition, the occupation of Bozcaada by Greece during the Balkan War is also included in detail in Ihsan Bey's memoirs. The originality of this study results from the fact that Ihsan Bey's memoirs when Italians reached to the entrance of the Dardanelles and regarding the occupation of Bozcaada are evaluated scientifically and published for the first time.

Materials and Methods: Baskent University Faculty of Dentistry students were invited to participate in the study in 2019. The participants were asked to complete the WEMWBS and a questionnaire describing their demographic details, social background and lifestyle habits. Results: A total of 268 dental students (68% females) participated in the survey, with a response rate of 85%. The overall WEMWBS score of the study population was 48.18 +/- 9.6. Statistically significant differences in WEMWBS scores were detected between first- and fourth-year (p<0.001) students and between fourth- and fifth-year students (p<0.001). Male students (p<0.001) whose first choice was to attend the school of dentistry (p=0.024) and who pursued hobbies (p=0.001) or regular sports activities (p=0.001) had significantly higher WEMWBS scores than those who did not. Dental students' smoking status (p=0.630), living accommodation (p=0.71) or parents' education level did not affect WEMWBS scores significantly. Conclusion: The mental well-being of dental students was influenced by their year of study, gender, first choice of school and pursuit of hobbies or regular sports activities. Factors that may affect the mental well-being of students should be carefully considered, and strategies should be implemented to monitor and promote well-being during the students' academic career.

The aim of this study is to introduce the new feature vector in the hybrid axis and multi-model in order to diagnose these disorders with more conventional methods. Two different databases are used, and the results are compared with the previous studies. Here, two types of fusion models (feature and decision level fusion) are used to increase the classification accuracy of the multi-model. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-model gives the highest classification accuracies with decision level fusion (DLF). Inspecting the results obtained from two databases, the highest accuracy rate (99.58%) is obtained with DLF. It is also seen from the experiments that the proposed feature vector helps to classify pathological data successfully, depending on their pathological conditions. Together with the proposed multi-model, both LSTM and CNN are found to be similarly successful in the classification of data in multi-model architecture. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of maternal anxiety and attitudes on adherence to ICS therapy in children with asthma. Method: The patient group included the children with mild to moderate persistent asthma, aged 6-11 years. Healthy children in a similar age range were included as a control group. The patient group was divided into two categories (treatment adherent and non-adherent) according to the regularity of ICS use. All patients were assessed with Childhood-Asthma Control Test (C-ACT), and their mothers were assessed using Parent Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) and Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: A total of 156 children (age: 7.4 +/- 1.4 years, F/M: 71/85) with persistent asthma and 60 healthy children (age: 7.5 +/- 1.3 years, F/M:25/35) were included in the study. The rate of adherence in children with asthma was 52.6%. Mothers of non-adherent patients had significantly higher BAI scores than those of the adherent patients and controls (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The number of mothers who indicated that they did not have enough information about asthma and treatment was also higher in the non-adherent group. PARI subtest scores were not different between the adherent and non-adherent groups. Conclusions: In our study, it was found that mothers' anxiety levels and their knowledge about asthma and medications were associated with treatment adherence in children with asthma. Psychological and educational support to the families of children with asthma would improve their treatment adherence and efficacy. (C) 2021 Codon Publications. Published by Codon Publications.

Here, we aimed to examine the prognostic factors after pulmonary metastasectomy in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective hospital-based observational case series study. We reviewed data for 607 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who were treated and observed from 2012 to 2019. Of the 607 patients with mCRC, 87 were with solitary lung metastases. Of the 87 patients, 39 were not appropriate for metastasectomy, while 15 patients recognized as suitable candidates by the multidisciplinary thoracic tumor board rejected metastasectomy. Consequently, only 33 patients were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Rectum was detected as the primary site in 16 (48.5%) patients. Over 80% of patients had metachronous lung metastases, with a median of 29.0 months from initial diagnosis. Video-assisted thoracic surgery with wedge resection was performed in 20 (60.6%) patients. Over 90% of patients had solitary metastasis resected, with 97% of R0 resection. Median tumor size was 23.0 mm (min: 10; max: 90). Adjuvant treatment was given to 31 (93.9%) patients, while neoadjuvant treatment was given only to 8 (25%) patients. Of the 33 patients, there were 25 (75.7%) relapses. The most frequent site of relapse was lung in 15 (45.5%) patients. Interestingly, there were only 4 (12.2%) patients who had a relapse in the liver after lung metastasectomy. We found that median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 43.0 (13.0-73.0) and 55.0 (31.6-78.4) months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary metastasectomy was associated with significantly long-time survival rates in mCRC (43 months of DFS and 55 months of OS). The second relapse occurred in 25 (75.7%) patients, with isolated lung metastases in nearly half of the patients (45.5%). Therefore, lung metastases in mCRC were unique and a multidisciplinary team including a thoracic surgeon should manage these patients.

This is the first case of severe hyper-insulinemic hypoglycemia in a 6-month-old infant secondary to an intraabdominal teratoma. The hypoglycemia resolved after surgical removal. Case Rreport: A 6-month-old infant was seen in a pediatric emergency department with complaints of lethargy and abnormal eye movements. She was diagnosed with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and started on diazoxide. A CT and MRI of the abdomen revealed a 165x77x72 mm cyst with a 51x45x30 mm solid structure connecting to the wall of the cyst by a stalk, raising suspicion of a fetus in fetu. The mass had no connection to her pancreas. Following total excision of the intraabdominal mass, her hypoglycemia resolved. Histopathological examination showed immature fetal pancreatic tissue consistent with a mature teratoma. Whole exon sequencing of the infant's peripheral blood showed a negative mutation of ABCC8 and presence of heterozygous variations of HNF1b and IRS1 genes. Conclusions: This is the first case report of an infant with severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia secondary to a pancreatic teratoma. The heterozygous variations of HNF1b and IRS1 genes likely played a role in the embryogenesis, causing a pancreatic teratoma and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.

We evaluated COVID-19 incidence among our hemodialysis patients and investigated the most probable immune mechanisms against COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Baskent University has 21 dialysis centers across Turkey, with 2420 patients on hemodialysis and 30 on peritoneal dialysis. Among these, we retrospectively evaluated 602 patients (257 female/345 male) with chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis as renal replacement therapy; 7 patients (1.1%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2. We retrospectively collected patient demographic characteristics, clinical data, and immunological factors affecting the clinical course of the disease. We divided patients into groups and included 2 control groups ( individuals with normal renal functions): group I included COVID-19-positive patients with normal renal function, group II included COVID-19-positive hemodialysis patients, group III included COVID-19-negative hemodialysis patients, and group IV included COVID-19-negative patients with normal renal function. Lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood and typing of human leukocyte antigens were analyzed in all groups, with killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor genes analyzed only in COVID-19-positive patients and healthy controls. Results: No deaths occurred among the 7 COVID-19-positive hemodialysis patients. Group I patients were significantly older than patients in groups II and III ( P = .039, P = .030, respectively) but not significantly different from group IV (P = .060). Absolute counts of natural killer cells in healthy controls were higher than in other groups (but not significantly). Activated T cells were significantly increased in both COVID-19-positive groups versus COVID-19-negative groups. Groups showed significant differences in C and DQ loci with respect to distribution of alleles in both HLA classes. Conclusions: Although immunocompromised patients are at greater risk for COVID-19, we found lower COVID-19 incidence in our hemodialysis patients, which should be further investigated in in vitro and molecular studies.
